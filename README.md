Dlang IDE
=========

Trying to write D language IDE using dlangUI library.

Build and run with DUB:

	git clone https://github.com/buggins/dlangide.git
	cd dlangide
	dub run

To develop in VisualD together with DlangUI, put this project on the same level as dlangui repository, and dependencies.

To run, it needs FreeImage.dll and directory /res in the same directory as executable.
